# Implement Feature Command

You will be implementing a new feature in this codebase based on the user's requirements.

## Feature Requirements
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the request**: Understand what feature needs to be implemented
2. **Plan the implementation**: 
   - Identify which files need to be created or modified
   - Determine the scope (frontend, backend, or both)
   - Break down into logical steps if complex

3. **Implement the feature**:
   - Create new files as needed
   - Modify existing files to integrate the feature
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the codebase
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation

4. **Test considerations**:
   - Consider edge cases
   - Ensure the feature works with existing functionality

5. **Documentation**:
   - If this is a **frontend feature**, document changes in `frontend-changes.md`
   - If this is a **backend feature**, document changes in `backend-changes.md` (create if doesn't exist)
   - Include what was changed and why

## Important Notes
- Do NOT ask for permission to modify files, implement directly
- Use best practices for the relevant framework/language
- Make incremental, focused changes
- Verify changes don't break existing functionality
- Keep changes clean and maintainable
